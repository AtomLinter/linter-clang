# linter-clang package

This linter plugin for [Linter](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter) provides an interface to clang. It will be used with files that have the "C", "C++", "Objective-C", or "Objective-C" syntax.

## Installation
Linter package must be installed in order to use this plugin. If Linter is not installed, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter).

### Plugin installation
```
$ apm install linter-clang
```

### Select C / C++ linter
- C linter, select C Grammar
- C++ linter, select C++ Grammar
- Objective-C linter, select Objective-C Grammar
- Objective-C++ linter, select Objective-C++ Grammar

### Project-specific include paths
If your project has some extra include directories, put them in a file called ".linter-clang-includes" and list them line by line or seperated by spaces.
The linter will open the file in those directories and use the specified paths when linting in your project.
